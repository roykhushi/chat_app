# chat_app

This is a Real-Time Chat Application implemented using Socket.io library in Node.js. The concept of WebSocket has been used in this project. Basically, WebSocket is a protocol that enables bi-directional communication between a client and a server and provides an efficient way to exchange data in real-time. It solves the problem of polling the server for changes which is a very slow process.

Socket.io is a library built on WebSocket and is popular for building the real-time applications.
